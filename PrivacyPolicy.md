# Price-Chex-Privacy-Policy

This privacy policy serves as the privacy policy for many apps published on Google Play by the EpicAppz team, unless a different privacy policy is explicitly provided:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Epic+Appz

This policy is subject to change with any update to the app.

CAMERA
Camera permission is required by the app for accessing the camera and capturing images/video from the device.
This permission allows this application to use the CAMERA function of the phone to scan barcodes in order for prices to be checked using the app.
Images taken in the app are not stored by Epic Appz online and are only used to provide necessary functions of the app.
Declining the camera permission still allows for use of the app, albeit with reduced functions.


DATA/STORAGE
No personal data is collected, stored or processed by EpicAppz, unless the user is informed in the app first. 
Data entered by the user is stored on the user's device in "History" and "Saved" menus in the app which is saved on the user's device and can be deleted by clearing app data.

WEB BROWSING
The app contains a basic webview/web browser component allowing the user to interact with different websites. 
As such, data may be passed to relevant websites to provide the user with the functions of the app.
EpicAppz is not responsible for any data entered by the user on any website viewed within the app, nor for the collection, storage or processing of data by third parties.


ADVERTISEMENTS
Where applicable, data may or may not be collected by third parties to enable the use of in-app advertisements.
Advertisements are served via Google Admob and are subject to the Google Admob policy.
By using the app, you agree that advertisements may be shown in the app according to the Google Admob policy.
EpicAppz is not responsible for the content of the advertisements or any interaction the user has with the advertisements. 

EpicAppz and any of its members is in no way affiliated with, and does not represent, any other company, including but not limited to those mentioned in the app and app description.
